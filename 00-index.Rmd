This document serves as a personal collection of

* tools for package development,
* good practices for programming,
* and most frequently used packages.

The material treated here certainly does not cover all of `R`, but rather serves as list of essential things related to programming in `R` that I find useful to know. The document is partly opinionated and subjective, so feel free to open up an <a href="https://github.com/dirmeier/essential-R/issues">issue</a> if you feel some parts should be clarified or reformulated.
