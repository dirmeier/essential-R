This book serves as a personal collection of

* tools for package development,
* good practices for programming,
* and most frequently used packages.

The material treated here certainly does not cover all of `R`, but rather serves as list of essential things related to programming in `R` that I find useful to know. The document is partly opinionated and subjective, so feel free to open up an <a href="https://github.com/dirmeier/essential-R/issues">issue</a> if you feel some parts should be clarified or reformulated.

The book is no introduction on how to program functionally, procedurally or in an object-oriented way, how to write code in general, or how to speed it up. The interested reader is referred to:

- Andrew Hunt: The Pragmatic Programmer,
