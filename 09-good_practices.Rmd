# Good practices

Continuous integration, version control and containerization are three of the many tools of a developer. Here, I quickly introduce how the three can be used for `R`.

## Continuous integration

To be honest, doing all the steps from the section above is tedious and annoying. For that reason I set up Travis CI to take care of running our tests, static analysis and code coverage in the project. Travis works for Mac and Unix.

```{bash}
cat ./pkg/.travis.yml
```

Check out Travis' <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/">docs</a> for more info. What we are basically telling Travis to do is to check our package `--as-cran`, run the unit tests, do the code coverage and finally do a static code analysis.

In order to do the same for Windows machines, we also use AppVeyor.

```{bash}
cat ./pkg/appveyor.yml
```

Here, we only run some tests and checks, since we already got the code analysis and coverage.

Code coverage of our project yielded us the following results:

<div align="center">

</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
  Code coverage
</div>

If we check the travis log, we see it has succeeded, because all tests ran through. However, we have some lints we should fix.

Fixing style related issues is essential since we want other people to be able to read our code easily. Good code also increases the number of users, because the package is more trusted than a *spaghetti code* package.

## Version control

Aside from he fact that version control is great, putting your project on GitHub has the most prominent advantage that you can add badges to your `README.md` to show others about the state of your package, for instance repository, CI or code coverage status.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://rawgit.com/dirmeier/essential-R/master/fig/readme_me.jpg" alt="oh no" width="750px">
</div>

There's a wide variety of badges to describe your project.
<div align="center">
| Description  | Badge |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Is the project passing on windows?  | <img src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dirmeier/netReg?branch=master&svg=true">  |
| How long is it on Bioconductor?  | ![](https://bioconductor.org/shields/years-in-bioc/netReg.svg)  |
| Is it installable using conda?  | ![](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/netreg/badges/installer/conda.svg)  |

## Code style

I try to follow two general guidelines when writing code. These are primarily not my personal preferences, nut adopted form packages like
`data.table`, `lme4`, `Matrix` or Bioconductor. 
Whatever you do, just be consistent. There seem to be a lot of different preference around.

If I mainly write using `S3` classes and functions I prefer writing code like this:

```{r ,eval=FALSE}
my.var <- "2"

i.am.a.function <- function(i) 
{
  sapply(seq(10), function(i) {
    i + 1
  })  
}

plot.me <- function(x, ...) plot.default(x)

.i.am.private <- "2"
```

For `S4` classes and functions I recommend using the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/coding-style/) style guide or how 
`lme4` and `Matrix` do it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setMethod("camelCaps",
          signature=signature(iAmAList = "list"))
```
